Java Spring MongoDb Url Shortner

# Functional Requirements:
  a. Given an URL, our service should generate a shorter and unique alias of it. This is called a short link. This link should be short enough to be easily copied and pasted into applications.
  b. When users access a short link, our service should redirect them to the original link.
  c. Users should have the option to pick a custom short link for their URL.
  d. Links will expire after a standard default timespan. Users should be able to specify the expiration time.
